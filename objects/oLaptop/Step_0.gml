//firingDelay = firingDelay -1;//reduces this variable by 1 every frame so that it eventually goes to 0, every time we fire a bullet we'll set firing delay to be like 5 or something, meaning that the next time we'll be able to shoot will be 5 frames after our last bullet was created

//keyShoot = keyboard_check_pressed(vk_space);
//image_angle = direction;

//if (keyShoot) && (firingDelay < 0) && (global.timer != 0)
//{
	//firingDelay = 0;
//	with (instance_create_layer(844,495,"Bullets",oBullet))//this approach allows us to run the code not just through the general object oBullet, but this specific instance of it whereas just setting up a new bullet variable wouldn't do that. 
//	{
	//	direction = point_direction(x,y,oPlayer.x,oPlayer.y);//makes the bullet move in the same direction the gun is facing, randomizes it slightly
	//	image_angle = point_direction(x,y,oPlayer.x,oPlayer.y);
